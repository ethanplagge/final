# N315 Final

# Purpose

- My goal with recreating the Keurig website was to learn and apply the basic principles of front end web development in an engaging way.
- This project helped to solidify concepts of web development such as URL data injection for page navigation, utilizing firebase for authentication, and using JSON to store data locally on the user's machine.
- Ultimately, this project was extremely helpful in solidifying some of the core aspects of front end web design, and how to properly create a working application that allows the user to create an account, login, and add items to a cart.
